2. How did you ensure that the HTML5 offline application cache worked?

The HTML5 offline application cache cannot be tested locally because 
a message will pop up asking, "This website is asking to store data 
for offline use." When I try to press accept, the button does not 
work. 

Thus, I pushed my performance folder to my jmao01.github.com repo 
and so that I could access my online application in 
http://jmao01.github.com/performance/index.html. This way, I could 
successfully press the accept button and check the application 
cache in firefox by looking under Options->Options->Advanced->
Offline Web Content and User Data. When I accept the application 
cache, disconnect from the tufts-guest wireless internet 
connection, and reenter the URL, the website still shows up.
